# Behavioral Pattern
### Behavioral Patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

# Types
 - ### [Chain Of Resposibility Pattern](../../../tree/main/Behavioral/Chain_Of_Resposibility)
 
 ![Visual Diagram Chain Of Resposibility Pattern](img/chain-of-responsibility-mini.png)
 
  behavioral design pattern that lets you pass requests along a chain of handlers...

 - ### [Command Pattern](../../../tree/main/Behavioral/Command)
 
 ![Visual Diagram Command Pattern](img/command-mini.png)
 
  in command pattern the request is send to the invoker and invoker pass it to the command object
  
  
 - ### [Iterator Pattern](../../../tree/main/Behavioral/Iterator)
 
 ![Visual Diagram Iterator Pattern](img/iterator-mini.png)
 
  this pattern is used when the data structure is variable and you want to iterate through it  
  
 - ### [Mediator Pattern](../../../tree/main/Behavioral/Mediator)
 
 ![Visual Diagram Mediator Pattern](img/mediator-mini.png)
 
  Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact
  
  
 - ### [Memento Pattern](../../../tree/main/Behavioral/Memento)
 
 ![Visual Diagram Memento Pattern](img/memento-mini.png)
 
  this pattern is used to manages state for using current state or the previous states in program.  
  
 - ### [Observer Pattern](../../../tree/main/Behavioral/Observer)
 
 ![Visual Diagram Observer Pattern](img/observer-mini.png)
 
  this pattern is used when we want to notify the changes of internal state of a class to other registered class
  
  - ### [State Pattern](../../../tree/main/Behavioral/State)
 
 ![Visual Diagram State Pattern](img/state-mini.png)
 
  this pattern is used when an object change its behavior based on its internal state.
  
   - ### [Strategy Pattern](../../../tree/main/Behavioral/Strategy)
 
 ![Visual Diagram Strategy Pattern](img/strategy-mini.png)
 
  The Strategy pattern suggests that you take a class that does something specific in a lot of different ways and extract all of these algorithms into       separate classes called strategies.

   - ### [Template Method Pattern](../../../tree/main/Behavioral/Template_Method)
 
 ![Visual Diagram Template Method Pattern](img/template-method-mini.png)
 
  this pattern is used when we have an algorithm or set of tasks that its use in multiple class and some of the step of this tasks/algorithms is identical   and some of it not.
