# Strategy Pattern

## Behavioral Type  

### Use cases:
this pattern is used when an object change its behavior based on its internals state
diffrent of strategy pattern and state pattern its that strategy there is no single state , diffrent behaviors represent by diffrent strategy objects.

### hints
a main class have some behavioral that the sub class have these too but not identical with eash other so every behavioral have interface and set of classes of that

# Classes
- Context - main class that get object for action
- Strategy   - the abstract class/interface that concreteStrategy classes implement it 
- ConcreteStrategy - class that take action on request diffrently from another concretestate class

# Interfaces
- Interface Strategy
