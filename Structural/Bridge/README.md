# Bridge Pattern

## Structural Type  

### Definition:
Bridge is a structural design pattern that lets you split a large
class or a set of closely related classes into two separate
hierarchies—abstraction and implementation—which can be
developed independently of each other.

(when we have two dimensional hierarchy we aplied this)
