# Composite Pattern

## Structural Type  

### Use cases:
this pattern is used when we want to represent a hierarchy and we want to treat the object of the hierarchy the same way;

# Classes
- Leaf - represents an individual part 
- Composite - group class or container class  


# Interfaces
- Component - contains operation method that common between Leaf and Composite
