# Factory Method Pattern

## Creational Type  

### Intent:
Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to
instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

### Definition
Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides
an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows
subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
