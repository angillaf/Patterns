# Prototype Pattern

## Creational Type  

### Intent:
Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new
objects by copying this prototype.

### Definition
Prototype is a creational design pattern that lets you copy
existing objects without making your code dependent on
their classes.
