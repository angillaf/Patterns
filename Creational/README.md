# Creational Pattern
### Creational design patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

# Types

- ### [Abstract Factory](../../../tree/main/Creational/Abstract_Factory)

![Visual Diagram Abstract Factory Pattern](img/abstract-factory-mini.png)

Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without
specifying their concrete classes.

- ### [Builder](../../../tree/main/Creational/Builder)

![Visual Diagram Builder Pattern](img/builder-mini.png)

Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without
specifying their concrete classes.

- ### [Factory Method](../../../tree/main/Creational/Factory)

![Visual Diagram Factory Method Pattern](img/factory-method-mini.png)

Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to
instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

- ### [Prototype](../../../tree/main/Creational/Prototype)

![Visual Diagram Prototype Pattern](img/prototype-mini.png)

Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new
objects by copying this prototype.

- ### [Singleton](../../../tree/main/Creational/Singleton)

![Visual Diagram Singleton Pattern](img/singleton-mini.png)

Ensure a class only has one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.
